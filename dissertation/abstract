We have developed an artificial intelligence for playing chess, which was the mind game that our team chose for our project. Our AI offers several difficulty levels catering for users ranging from complete beginners to reasonably experienced players. Our program is written from the ground up in Java, though it uses WinBoard, a chess GUI for the UI, and as such can currently only be used on windows machines. We do however also provide a simple command line interface which can be used with any operating system.
