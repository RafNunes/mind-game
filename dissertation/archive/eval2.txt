The second phase took place just before the winter break. At this point the game allowed a user to play against another human opponent on a textual user interface. At this stage the most important thing was to test that a game could be completed and all 'special' moves (i.e. castling, promotion etc.) could be played. It was also important that illegal moves could not be played, the game obviously can not allow users to play illegal moves.

The testing for this stage was very informal as it involved members of the team playing chess against each or other, or against friends, to ensure full games could be played with chess rules. As bugs were discovered they were reported to Demian TIll who attempted to fix them. This process of was then iterated until the program could play a full game successfully. It was important that this testing was done correctly as our requirements clearly stated that the game must work within the rules.
